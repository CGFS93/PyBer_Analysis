# PyBer Analysis

## Overview:

Create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
Using the Python graphing library Matplotlib, visualization features. Matplotlib was created as a Python alternative for MATLAB. MATLAB, which is short for matrix laboratory, was developed by the company MathWorks in the 1980s. It enabled scientists to perform linear algebra and numerical analysis without learning the programming language Fortran, which until then had been the best option for complex computations. Matplotlib is a graphing and plotting library for Python that comes with the Anaconda installation. To use it with Jupyter Notebook, all we need to do is import it. Matplotlib is often used with another Python library, NumPy, a numerical mathematics library for making arrays or matrices. A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure, or a list of lists, in which numbers are arranged into rows and columns. Create and annotate vertical and horizontal bar charts. Bar charts are particularly helpful when comparing datasets over time or when your line chart starts to look cluttered because it has too many lines.
 
### Purpose

Project: Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create visualization.

## Resources

**Data Source:** city_data.csv, ride_data.csv.

## Summary:

Matplotlib has an advantage over Excel when it comes to graphing because of the robust features it offers. You can use it to create a wide range of graphs, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, histograms, 3D plots, log plots, and polar plotsâ€”to name just a few.

Matplotlib also has rich styling options. You can customize annotations for chart axes, titles and legends, the color and size of lines, bars, and bubbles, and the chart's background. It also lets you save and print publication-quality charts. Because of these features, Matlplotlib is one of the most popular plotting libraries for Python.

Matplotlib has two methods for graphing data. One uses MATLAB's plotting syntax and functionality and the other uses an object-oriented interface. MATLAB's plotting syntax is concise and the most useful when creating simple plots that require little coding. This method is most effective when graphing data directly from a DataFrame. The object-oriented method is better suited to more complicated graphs that require more coding, such as those with multiple lines or bars, or multiple plots in one graph.

A bar chart tells a different visual story than a line chart. There are many benefits to using a bar chart. They're good at displaying discrete data (i.e., data based on counts) in distinct columns. They also tend to be visually strong. For example, adding color to the bars can make a chart really shine for your audience.

A bar chart can be used to clearly compare two or more datasets, either by displaying them side by side or by using a stacked bar chart. Bar charts can provide more visual appeal and information compared to having multiple lines on the same graph, which can mask the underlying information.
